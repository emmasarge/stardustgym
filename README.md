## Overview

This is a responsive website for a gym including a welcome page with a brief overview of what the gym offers, a page describing available amenities, a class schedule and an intuitive sign-up/contact form. The objective of the website is to attract members using modern design with a fun 80’s influence and being very easy to navigate and user-friendly. Using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to develop an attractive and engaging site, I aim to provide an accessible platform for potential clients and current members to use to contact the gym, see what’s new and check the schedule and potentially book classes.

## User Stories

* As a first time user I want to be attracted to the site’s presentation. 
* As a first time user, I want to understand the services of the gym.
* I want to be able to feel confident this gym is professional. 
* I want to be able to navigate the site easily. 
* I want to be able to  easily contact the gym with any questions or to sign-up. 
* I want to know how to access the gym’s social media. 
* I would like to be able to use the site on my desktop and mobile.

## Project Goals 

* Stardust Gym wants to attract potential clients.
* Stardust Gym’s website should be easily accessible from any desktop, mobile or tablet.
* The website should promote the band awareness.
* I want to grow my social media following.
* I want to be contactable by potential clients. 
* I want an easy to navigate a website for customers. 

## UX 

This website creates an enjoyable environment reflective of its physical environment (the gym itself) and services. The intention is for visitors to feel welcome, positive and excited when entering the site with the colours, patterns and images. The simple approach to the layout provides a very simple journey for the site visitor. In terms of increasing memberships, the site is efficient in navigation and information as to not overwhelm the customer to have the visitor leave the site to consider the gym but not complete membership. I also want to make sure the site feels inclusive with information and design to not be off-putting for people interested in improving their fitness.

## Strategy 

The goal of the Stardust Gym website is to attract potential members and act as a reference for current members by providing weekly schedule, booking and a contact form. By using using clean and modern design interwoven with 1980’s design, the site also provides a warm visual experience.

### Stardust Gym Business Goals: 

* Promote brand awareness.
* Increase membership and attract people who are new and familiar to fitness.
* Provide information to new visitors and current members. 
* Accessible mobile/tablet/desktop responsive design.
* Intuitive layout and design for a positive experience for site visitors.

### Customer Goals: 

* Easy to navigate.   
* Website reflects the quality of the gym to trust their reputation from first impression.
* Website works on phone, tablet and desktop.
* Website provides adequate information about the gym and its services.
* It is very easy to contact the gym via the site.
* Site connects to social media. 
* Gym provides a positive experience for fitness to try something new. 

## Scope 

Stardust Gym is built upon research for user-friendly websites, exciting yet tasteful design and customer demands compared to other gym websites. The site is simple, direct, fun and easy to navigate to attract membership without being distracting or off-putting.

## Structure 

I plan to keep the layout of the website to be very simple with a trusted and known style of navigation bar and footer. The body of the website will be reflective upon each page’s intent of information. Each link opens a page on a new tab.

## Skeleton 

I created my wireframes initially on paper with pen and then onto balsamiq. They aren’t the most detailed and I would like to improve on this for any future projects.
- Note: To open links in a new tab, please use CTRL+click (on Windows and Linux) or CMD+click (on macOS).

### Colors

I applied a clean and warm color scheme to Stardust Gym’s website 

For the navbar, footer and background I used a warm off-white called #fafafa which I learned about from the Code Institute course create a clean effect without being too cold and bright. The warmth of this white is more modern and easy on the eyes. The light color brings the navigation links and footer to the attention to the site visitor to enhance UX.

I based the rest of the site’s color scheme on an old ad I found from the 80’s and used a color picker from ColorZilla to match tones. I wanted to maintain an analogue and modern feel so I used grey, black, red and yellow. 

Black: #1a0f17
Yellow: rgb(255, 225, 0)
Red: #d73b27
Off-white: #fafafa


### Font

Initially I was looking for an 80’s neon sign-like font but found a cleaner font called Monoton from Google Fonts. I paired this with a very clean and classic Gill Sans for the body text. I wanted to maintain a crisp and modern appearance to the overall site and decided to work with just two fonts to achieve this.

## Features

*Navigation bar
*Responsive links

#### Future Features

I would like to add a booking element for site visitors to book and pay for a class adhoc. I would also like to add some video elements and a blog with upcoming offers and workout tips, this page would be exclusive to members who are signed in with their username to the site. I would also like to improve the SEO and maintain a simple and efficient design and content.

## Testing

* All links in content and social media links work. 
* Contact form works.

* Checked the CSS with the w3 validator.

### Feedback from Testing Users

* The contact page heading doesn’t adapt to a smaller screen. ‘Membership’ falls beyond the lines of its display box.
* List pricing on the page.
* Include a blog or a page for news for the gym.
* The red text boxes on the homepage are too transparent against the zebra print for the text to be readable.

## Challenges
